# Tutorials

Here is where we can put any tutorials or videos about Sketchbox.

## Videos

### Embedded YouTube Video
We can embed YouTube videos from a URL:

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MbZ-jgMwF-E"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
/>

### Native Video

Or we can host the videos ourselves:

<video width="560" controls>
  <source src="@source/videos/Overview_2022-04-15_11-52-15.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag
</video>
